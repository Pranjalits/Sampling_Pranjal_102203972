# Sampling_Pranjal_102203972
In this repository, I have done the following tasks:
1) Convert the Credtcard_data into balanced class data-set.
2) Created five samples
3) Applied five different sampling techniques ( Sampling1, Sampling2, Sampling3,Sampling4, Sampling5) on five different ML models (M1, M2, M3, M4 and M5)
4) Determined which sampling technique gives higher accuracy.
